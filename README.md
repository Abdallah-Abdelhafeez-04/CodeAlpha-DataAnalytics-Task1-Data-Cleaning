# CodeAlpha-DataAnalytics-Task1-Data-Cleaning
In this task, I cleaned a raw dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats. Using Python (pandas), I prepared the data for analysis by dropping/handling NaNs, removing duplicate rows, and standardizing text formats. The final cleaned dataset is ready for further analytics and modeling.
