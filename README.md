# Codeveda-Sentiment-DatasetAnalysis-Task1-Data-Cleaning
In this task, I cleaned a raw dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats. Using Python (pandas), I prepared the data for analysis by dropping/handling NaNs, removing duplicate rows, and standardizing text formats. The final cleaned dataset is ready for further analytics and modeling.


## Overview
This task focuses on cleaning a raw dataset with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
The dataset used: *Sentiment Dataset*.  

## Steps Done
- Loaded dataset using **pandas**
- Checked missing values and handled them (drop/fill)
- Removed duplicate rows
- Standardized categorical formats
- Saved cleaned dataset for further analysis

## Description
In this task, I worked with a raw dataset that contained missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats. 
The goal was to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, regex), I:
- Loaded the dataset into pandas
- Handled missing values (dropped or imputed where necessary)
- Removed duplicate rows
- Standardized inconsistent data formats (text cleaning, categorical normalization)
- Saved the cleaned dataset for further analysis
## How to Run
  - Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

       1.Open my notebook in Colab: Task1_Data_Cleaning.ipynb

       2.Upload the raw dataset (3) Sentiment dataset.csv) to the Colab session.

       3.Run all cells step by step.

       4.The cleaned dataset will be saved as sentiment_dataset_cleaned.csv.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Output
- Notebook: `Task1_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`
- Cleaned Dataset: `sentiment_dataset_cleaned.csv`
